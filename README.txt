Organisation of Folder:

- The Folder is seperated in two subfolder the /Isotropic and the /Anistropic


- /Isotropic Folder:

	* Contains following Subfolder:
		+ EKF_UKF_PF: --> This folder contains the three Algorithms which were developed for the first part of the Assignment

		+ Particle Filder Investigation: --> This folder contains the Code for 6 different Resampling algorithms which were tested
					 	      and compared

		+ Advanced Filder Design: -->	This folder contains the algorithms which were used for the development of an advanced filter algorithm#
                Methods:
                - Extended  Kalman Filter
                - Unscended Kalman Filter
                - Adaptive  Kalman Filter
                - H-Infinty Filter 
                - Particle  Filter
                - Extended  Particle Filter
                - Unscendet Particle Filter
                - Adpative  H-Inf  Filter



- /Anisotropic Folder:

	* Contains following Subfolder:
		+ EKF_UKF_PF: --> This folder contains the three Algorithms which were developed for the second part of the Assignment (Compare EKF, UKF, PF)

		+ Advanced Filder Design: -->	This folder contains the algorithms which were used for the development of an advanced filter algorithm 
                
                Methods:
